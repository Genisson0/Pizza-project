# Pizza-project
A game about pizzas.

**Open for contributions**
This game was a small JavaScript training project. It's using concepts such as classes, prototype object and others.
To play this little game you need to install javascript on your machine and a code editor like vscode. But it can also be accessed via browser using gitHub pages.
